# Lightweight AI NAS OS

This repository contains the first runnable vertical slice of Lightweight AI NAS OS: a low-dependency Node control plane and responsive browser interface designed to remain practical on constrained hardware.

## What works now

- Safe first-run appliance setup
- Scrypt password hashing and secure, HTTP-only login sessions
- Responsive login, dashboard, sidebar, and mobile navigation
- Live Linux CPU, memory, kernel, uptime, and mounted-filesystem inventory
- Capability detection for core NAS, containers, VMs, local AI, and directory services
- Persistent shared-folder definitions for SMB, NFS, and SFTP workflows
- Recent activity timeline
- Atomic local configuration writes
- API validation, request-size limits, security headers, and protected endpoints
- Automated tests for setup, authentication, inventory, and share creation

The current share workflow creates the control-plane definition. It does **not yet** modify Samba, NFS exports, Unix permissions, partitions, RAID arrays, or user data. Those operations belong to the upcoming privileged storage agent and will be protected by preview and confirmation steps.

## Run locally

Requirements: Linux or macOS and Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080`.

To make the preview reachable from another computer on the LAN:

```bash
NAS_HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

Do not expose this development milestone directly to the public internet.

## One-command Debian/Ubuntu installation

Run as `root` on the NAS host or test LXC:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyverax/LightNAS/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer adds Node.js 22 when required, checks out LightNAS under
`/opt/lightnas`, keeps appliance state under `/var/lib/lightnas`, and installs
an automatically starting `lightnas.service`. Open port `3080` at the IP shown
when installation finishes.

To update an existing Git-based installation, run the same command again.
The installer performs a fast-forward-only source update and preserves the
state stored in `/var/lib/lightnas`.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NAS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP listen address |
| `NAS_PORT` | `3080` | HTTP listen port |
| `NAS_DATA_FILE` | `data/state.json` | Persistent control-plane state |
| `NAS_DEV` | unset | Disables static caching when set |

State is written atomically with owner-only file permissions. Production deployment will add TLS termination, encrypted secret storage, persistent sessions, CSRF tokens, rate limiting, and a root-owned privileged agent with a narrow authenticated command interface.

## Next engineering milestone

The next milestone is the storage agent and operation framework:

1. Enumerate physical disks through `/sys`, `lsblk`, SMART, and udev.
2. Model disks, pools, filesystems, shares, and health independently.
3. Generate an exact impact preview for every storage mutation.
4. Run approved operations through a narrow root-owned service.
5. Add progress events, cancellation boundaries, logs, and rollback metadata.
6. Configure Samba/NFS shares with idempotent adapters and validation.
